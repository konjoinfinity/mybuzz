Widmark formula
BAC = (0.806 _ SD _ 1.2)/(BW _ Wt)-(MR _ DP)

0.806 is a constant for body water in the blood (mean 80.6%),
SD is the number of standard drinks, that being 10 grams of ethanol each,
1.2 is a factor to convert the amount in grams to Swedish standards set by
The Swedish National Institute of Public Health,
BW is a body water constant (0.58 for males and 0.49 for females),
Wt is body weight (kilogram),
MR is the metabolism constant (0.015 for males and 0.017 for females) and
DP is the drinking period in hours.[2]
10 converts the result to permillage of alcohol

Time is a variable - ideally a chron job that runs every minute to
update the BAC, for now we could ask how long ago did you have the drink

If user.buzzes.length == 1 run function as normal
If user.buzzes.length >= 2, run function with time elapsed included and
Loop through buzzes based on buzz.length and run function for each

Have to calculate based on current date/timestamp - add later
Calculate all BAC's from latest buzz drink date/timestamp
